This blog started as a demo for static content generators on IPFS as a great alternative to clunky, expensive, insecure, hard to manage and scale CMS platforms like WordPress.  

I thought HA, no back-end infra to manage, applications rich in features, and easy to automate deployments would impress my audience, but although they liked the demo, they failed to see how WordPress could be de-throned.   

My blog will live to fight that argument another day. In the meantime, Iâ€™d be happy to use it as a vent for articulating all the internal discussions taking place in the back of my consciousness about projects Iâ€™ve done, plan to do or playing with for various reasons. 

## On the importance of writing 

I love reading Nathan Martzâ€™s blog since discovering Clojure first and then his project Apache Storm, a real time stream processing engine. Those were the days when I was immersed in BigData technologies and projects. He is a great writer and simply [suggests writing makes you a better reader and smarter](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html). 

We become more receptive to other peopleâ€™s ideas and learn how to structure our train of thoughts to be better understood. Instead of wasting energy on unproductive counter claims, for the sake of an argument, we are more likely to engage in meaningful discussions by focusing on the important parts. 

We are all indebted to great writers to become what we are. Without any expectations on readership of my personal musings I will find a great pleasure in sharing my experience and work with no one in particular. 

## To be alive 

More literally inclined minds would note that we write to be alive, make art of everyday DevOps moments.  

I cannot recall if I felt adventurous in the search for a new life perspective when I started writing. As the time passed, I for sure felt more alive and connected to others. Writing has been the best medium for reaching to various audiences at work. People who would find my writings interesting would invite me for talks within their communities which would give me opportunities to get familiar with their work, and this in turn would provide me more material for future writings, talks and demo. Iâ€™d become a regular, and sometimes start a project, with them based on these exchanges. 

On those occasions when I ventured outside the corporate walls to present my work or ideas, I was always met by curious minds which just increased my enthusiasm for writing and giving public talks. Exchanging ideas with the outside world is especially important to mitigate the risks created by cognitive biases. The longer you work with the same group of people the higher the risks. If you deny this maybe it is time to go out and give a talk in front of total strangers ðŸ˜Š.   

## Chronology of ideas 

I wished I started writing earlier if for nothing else to document some ideas or projects. Iâ€™d be happy to read my writings with some time distance between us, trying to understand my motivations and reasoning behind my ideas. Would I recognize myself in my writing? Does it mean I have evolved as a writer if my old writing feels unpolished, imprecise or unfocused?  

Itâ€™s an interesting thought worth exploring. I will know more soon.
