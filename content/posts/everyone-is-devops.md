The first presentation I’ve made after joining Wiley was about Infra-as-code (IaC) automation and it had the sub-title “Everyone is a DevOps now”. The idea is simple. DevOps is a culture, not a job description.  Everyone can and should adopt it regardless of his or her title.

If anything, I help others to start adopting DevOps best practices and trying not to be the proverbial gatekeeper standing in their way. Everyone interested should join the party and learn how to automate infra provisioning and management and collaborate with others over a source code repository. Usually, it takes a session or two to get people going with IaC automation. 

Once people master it they show appreciation for code reviews, GitHub workflows, code reuse, testing and collaboration.
