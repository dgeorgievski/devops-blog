Initially, I wanted to name this blog "Uneducated DevOps" in homage to the [Uneducated Economist](https://uneducatedeconomist.com/), street level thoughts, opinions, analysis and perspectives from a working-class point of view, but my better half thought I could do better with my choice of adjectives. 

Unlike [Paul Krugman](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoodman/2015/09/21/keynesianism-vs-paul-krugman-and-why-we-arent-growing-faster/?sh=3dca3d801357), the intellectually bankrupt, orthodox Keynesian hiding behind meaningless charts and sophistry to distort simple economic truths, the Uneducated Economists breaks complex topics and breaks them to a level that everyone could understand them using his experience and observing the ebb and flow of commodities like lumber.  

## The importance of experience 

Like the economy, DevOps is a not an exact science, but an art that you master over time working on real projects. The more you try (and fail) the better you become at it.  Provided you like working with people from different walks of life, over a period of time you accumulate enough experience and knowledge to fearlessly apply it to new problems.  Then, if you care about titles, you could call yourself a DevOps.  

I always thought of myself as a fixer. A person who finds fun in connecting different groups of people and finds solutions for their problems.  The DevOps title piggybacked at one point on the success of the Cloud and virtualization technologies. If nothing else, buzzwords aside, the industry started to recognize the importance of cross team collaboration to reduce the red tape, toil and inefficiencies of infrastructure and application management. 

## Teach a man to fish  

After joining a new company, I usually try to fix their biggest problem head on. Helping people to be more productive opens new possibilities for collaboration.  Every organization is unique.  

The beginning at Wiley was interesting to say the least. The company was at the beginning of its journey towards the Cloud and opportunities for improvements abounded. But, for the many of the SREs the first dilemma to solve was choosing the starting point for their Infra-as-Code trajectory.  

They were enthusiastically exchanging lists of must-read DevOps books, and online courses, but had a hard time picking the tools, services and best practices that could help them with taming their infrastructure and applications. The problem was compounded by outdated company policies on allowed tools and services.  

In the face of too many unknowns, my choice has always been to pick up a real project and teach SREs by asking them to add Infra-as-Code automation improvements themselves while I am watching over their shoulders. These sessions remind of pair-programming over a shared screen and are very effective. In a session or two people master all the elements of managing some Cloud resource over a GitHub repo, and are capable of continuing on their own. My only request is that the trainees teach others in their team of their newly acquired experience.  

This hands-on approach works really well. Itâ€™s not just that people drop their mental restraints fast, but in a short period of time they start innovating. Before long about seven-eight globally distributed SRE teams started using two central repositories: one to manage a Cloud infrastructure with Terraform, and another for managing re-usable and versioned Terraform modules.  

The first Kubernetes cluster sprung up into existence after about seven months. It should have happened even faster but there were others scores to settle with the Cloud and Sec teams first. Can you automate anything if you cannot control your DNS zone and Security Groups? Relinquishing control and focusing instead all that energy on collaboration, trust, and reviews takes some convincing and talking.  

## Fail fast 

The first rule of a DevOps club is do not be afraid to make a mistake. The second rule of a DevOps club is do not be afraid to make a mistake.  

The fear of failing, breaking or using something that is perceived expensive is paralyzing for newbies. I have to continuously emphasize that you cannot learn unless you fail and Iâ€™d be shocked if they wonâ€™t fail. This comes from my rich experience of failing ðŸ˜Š 

It is so much better to fail immediately and know that something is not working, then spend the time in endless, fruitless debates about possible options. 

## So, what is a DevOps? 

Learn you some Git and software engineering, donâ€™t be shy of talking to strangers and afraid of breaking things. Everything else comes with the e**xperience**.
