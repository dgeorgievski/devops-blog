My DevOps blog has been long overdue. I just couldn’t find the time or the right platform to host it. WordPress or Drupal would not cut it. I helped friends to use them but was never attracted to them. What to say of bloated, badly engineered, and hard to manage apps that forces its users to become MySQL experts?

The turning point came when I got exposed to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and was eager to show case it in combination with static Web site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) as a modern, lightweight, and cost-effective alternative to traditional CMS mastodonts. 

The revolution didn’t happen …yet, but once that point was reached, there was no turning back. IPFS was just a stepping stone to the world of decentralized technologies that is blockchains, decentralized apps and identities combined with economic incentives to minimize waste and maximize certain outcomes. 

We are witnessing history. Traditional banks, that are still using fax machines for the simplest wire transfer of money, are going the way of the dodo while at the same time decentralized technologies are reshaping the Internet and democratizing access to cloud services.

It would be interesting to see how these developments will affect Kubernetes and DevOps. There might be little if any infra to automate, dApps don’t need orchestration and execute in users browsers, downtime as a concept might cease to exist, identities are decentralized and bound to users’ blockchain wallets, cryptography is foundational block of blockchains which makes them inherently more secure and a great platform for trustless computations.

While thinking of the future I am helping my employer to automate the cloud and manage everything as code. The biggest challenge has always been how to do that effectively as an organization with ever growing infra and teams managing or using it while the proverbial tech ground beneath your feet is continuously shifting.  

If nothing else, I’ll try to document this journey and share my experiences with the world. I know it’s a cliché, but I am standing on the shoulders of others who have influenced my views and helped me become what I am today. Sharing is the least I could do to maybe help someone embrace Kubernetes in the cloud amidst mind numbing plethora of choices.

Whether I’d go back in time and mention things when Apache Ant was all the rage for automation would depend on my mood for [the search of lost time](https://www.the-philosophy.com/proust-search-lost-time-summary).
